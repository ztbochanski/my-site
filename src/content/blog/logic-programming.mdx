Logic programming is a paradigm of declarative programming. 
Instead of detailing control flow actions, programs in logic 
programming express statements in symbolic logic.

## Declarative Programming Recap
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming" target="_blank">Declarative programming</a>
focuses on specifying what needs to be done rather than how to do it. 
In a declarative language, the programmer outlines the desired results without 
specifying detailed procedures.

```sql
-- SQL is a declarative language
select lastname, firstname
from employees
where department = 'Engineering'
```

## Logic programming


Logic programming involves executing programs using an inference system to prove stated goals. 
It uses variable instantiation, clause resolution, and backtracking when logical inconsistencies arise. 
This non-deterministic feature enables logic programs to find multiple solutions.

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm" target="_blank">non-deterministic</a>
 algorithm is an algorithm that, even for the same input, can exhibit different behaviors on different runs.

```prolog
% Prolog is a declarative language
% Find the parent of a child
parent(X, Y) :- child(Y, X).
```

## Propositional logic

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus" target="_blank">Propositional logic</a>
 is a form of logic that deals with propositions, which are statements that can be either true or false. Propositional logic is used to represent the logical relationships between propositions. It is a form of [predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic) that uses only propositional variables and the logical connectives `and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, and `iff`.

- negation `¬`
- conjunction `∧`
- disjunction `∨`
- implication `→`
- equivalence `↔`

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrastive_conjunction" target="_blank">contrastive conjunction</a>
 is false for every value of its propositional variables.

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)" target="_blank">tautology</a>
 is a logical statement that is always true.

## First-order predicate logic

Propositional logic is useful but it has limited expressive power. This prevents generalization. [First-order predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) extends propositional logic with the use of objects, relations, constants, and functions.

Symbolic logic is used to express the basic needs of formal logic:

- express propositions
- express relationships between propositions
- describe how new propositions can be inferred from other propositions
