## Formal Language

[Formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language)  is a specific type of language defined by a set of rules 
known as a formal grammar. These rules precisely define all the possible strings 
or sequences of symbols that belong to the language. These strings defined 
by a formal grammar "well-formed strings" or "well-formed formulas." Essentially, 
a formal language comprises all the well-formed strings that adhere to its grammar rules.

## Formal grammar

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar" target="_blank">formal grammar</a> 
is a set of rules that precisely define all the possible strings in a formal language. 
These rules determine the structure and composition of valid strings or formulas 
within the language. Formal grammars don't concern themselves with the meaning or 
context of the strings; they focus solely on their form or structure.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy" target="_blank">chomsky hierarchy</a> defines four levels of grammars:

0. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_grammar" target="_blank">Unrestricted grammar</a>
1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar" target="_blank">Context-sensitive grammar</a>
2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar" target="_blank">Context-free grammar</a>
3. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_grammar" target="_blank">Regular grammar</a>
