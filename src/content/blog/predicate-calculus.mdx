<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_calculus" target="_blank">Predicate calculus</a> is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with the logical relationships between propositions. It is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic" target="_blank">predicate logic</a> that uses only propositional variables and the logical connectives like `and`, `or`, `not`, `if`, and `iff`.

## Horn Clauses

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause" target="_blank">Horn clause</a>
 is a logical formula containing at most one positive literal. A Horn clause has a particular form that is efficient and useful when solving logic programs. The term Horn clause is capitalized because it is named for the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Horn" target="_blank">Alfred Horn.</a>


## Resolution and Unification

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)" target="_blank">Resolution</a>
 is a rule of inference that allows inferred propositions to be computed from given propositions.

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)" target="_blank">Unification</a>
 is a pattern-matching process that determines what particular instantiations can be made to variables during a series of resolutions.
