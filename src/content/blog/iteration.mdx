<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration">Iteration</a> is a control structure used to repeat a sequence of steps. An iterative statement, also known as a loop, is a common mechanism in imperative languages.

## Types of Iteration

**1. Counting Loop**: `iterate a certain number of times`

Counting loops are a type of iteration structure where a sequence of steps is repeated a certain number of times. These loops are particularly useful when you know in advance how many times you need to repeat a task. In languages like Python, C, Java, and many others, counting loops are typically implemented using constructs like for loops or while loops with a counter variable.

```py
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**2. Logic Loop**: `iterate until a certain condition is reached`

Logic loops, also known as conditional loops, iterate until a certain condition is met. These loops are used when you need to repeat a task until a specific condition becomes false or true. In languages like Python, C, and JavaScript, while loops are commonly used for logic-based iteration.

```py
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

**3. Traversal Loop**: `iterate through items in a collection`

Traversal loops are used to iterate through items in a collection, such as arrays, lists, or dictionaries. These loops are valuable when you need to perform operations on each item in the collection. In languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, constructs like for loops are commonly used for traversal.

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```


## Logically Controlled Iteration

Logically controlled iteration refers to the ability to control the flow of iteration based on certain conditions. Pre-test loops evaluate the condition before executing the loop body, while post-test loops evaluate the condition after executing the loop body.

**<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop#Pre-test_loop">pre test loop</a>**

```py
x = 5
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```

**<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop#Post-test_loop">post test loop</a>**

```py
x = 5
while True:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
    if x <= 0:
        break
```

## Collection-Based Iteration

Collection-based iteration involves traversing data structures like arrays, lists, sets, or dictionaries. In languages like Python and Ruby, there are built-in methods and constructs to iterate over collections efficiently. `Traversing data structures` is a common task in programming, and collection-based iteration is a powerful tool for performing operations on each item in a collection.

In an iterator-based loop, an iterator walks along with elements from a data structure according to some predefined order. The number of elements in the data structure effectively controls the loop iteration.

Examples:

**Blocks in Ruby**

A block in `ruby` is a way to group together statements.

```ruby
[2, 4, 6, 8].each { |n| puts "Number #{n}" }
```

These concepts are fundamental in programming and are used extensively to control the flow of execution and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
