<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)" target="_blank">Expressions</a> are combinations of operators, constants, and variables that are evaluated to determine a value. Inspired by mathematical notation, expressions combine operands, operators, parenthesis, and function calls in order to perform a calculation or make a logical determination.

## Operators

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">Operators</a> are special symbols that represent computations like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation. They are used to construct expressions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operand" target="_blank">Operands</a> are the values that operators act on. They can be literals, variables, or expressions.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation" target="_blank">binary operators</a> take two operands, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation" target="_blank">unary operators</a> take one.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation" target="_blank">bitwise operators</a> operate on bits, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective" target="_blank">logical operators</a> operate on boolean values.

## Evaluation Order

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations" target="_blank">Order of operations</a> is the order in which operators are evaluated. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Associativity" target="_blank">Associativity</a> is the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation" target="_blank">infix notation</a> is the most common way to write expressions. Operators are written between their operands. For example, `a + b` is an infix expression.

## Type Conversion

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion" target="_blank">Type conversion</a> is the conversion of an expression from one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type" target="_blank">data type</a> to another. This is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion#Type_casting" target="_blank">type casting</a>.
