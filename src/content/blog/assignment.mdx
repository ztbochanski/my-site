An imperative language consists of a sequential series of changes to the program state. The [assignment](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)>) statement is the primary mechanism to change the values of variables in memory.

## Assignment operators

Examples of assignment operators (language dependent):

- `=` is the assignment operator. 
>^It assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. The result of the assignment is the value assigned.

## Assignment expressions

Assignment expressions are expressions that assign a value to a variable. The value of an assignment expression is the value assigned.

Examples of assignment expressions (language dependent):

- `a = b` assigns the value of `b` to `a`.
- `a += b` adds the value of `b` to `a` and assigns the result to `a`.
- `a -= b` subtracts the value of `b` from `a` and assigns the result to `a`.

## Conditional assignment

Conditional assignment is an assignment that is only performed if a condition is true.

Examples of conditional assignment (language dependent):

- `a = b if c` assigns the value of `b` to `a` if the value of `c` is true.

## Compound assignment

Compound assignment is an assignment that is performed in multiple steps.

Examples of compound assignment (language dependent):

- `a = b + c` assigns the sum of the values of `b` and `c` to `a`.
- `a = b * c` assigns the product of the values of `b` and `c` to `a`.
- `a = b / c` assigns the quotient of the values of `b` and `c` to `a`.
- `a = b % c` assigns the remainder of the division of the values of `b` and `c` to `a`.
- `a = b << c` assigns the value of `b` shifted left by the number of bits specified by the value of `c` to `a`.
- `a = b >> c` assigns the value of `b` shifted right by the number of bits specified by the value of `c` to `a`.

## Chained assignment

Chained assignment is an assignment that assigns the value of one variable to another variable.

Examples of chained assignment (language dependent):

- `a = b = c` assigns the value of `c` to `b` and assigns the value of `b` to `a`.

## Parallel assignment

Parallel assignment is an assignment that assigns multiple values to multiple variables.

Examples of parallel assignment (language dependent):

- `a, b = c, d` assigns the value of `c` to `a` and the value of `d` to `b`.

## More examples of assignment operators

- `+=` is the addition assignment operator. 
>^It adds the value of its right operand to its left operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `-=` is the subtraction assignment operator. 
>^It subtracts the value of its right operand from its left operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `*=` is the multiplication assignment operator. 
>^It multiplies the value of its right operand by its left operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `/=` is the division assignment operator. 
>^It divides the value of its left operand by its right operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `%=` is the remainder assignment operator. 
>^It divides the value of its left operand by its right operand and assigns the remainder of the division to its left operand.
- `<<=` is the left shift assignment operator. 
>^It shifts the value of its left operand by the number of bits specified by its right operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `>>=` is the right shift assignment operator. 
>^It shifts the value of its left operand by the number of bits specified by its right operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `&=` is the bitwise AND assignment operator. 
>^It performs a bitwise AND operation on the value of its left operand and the value of its right operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `^=` is the bitwise XOR assignment operator. 
>^It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the value of its left operand and the value of its right operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
- `|=` is the bitwise OR assignment operator. 
>^It performs a bitwise OR operation on the value of its left operand and the value of its right operand and assigns the result to its left operand.
