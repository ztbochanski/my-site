In computer science, [orthogonality](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality_(programming)>) means that operations change just one thing without affecting others. The term is most-frequently used regarding assembly instruction sets, as orthogonal instruction set.

Orthogonality in a programming language means that a relatively small set of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to build the control and data structures of the language. It is associated with simplicity; the more orthogonal the design, the fewer exceptions. This makes it easier to learn, read and write programs in a programming language
