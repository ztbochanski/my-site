## Event handling

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_handling" target="_blank">Event handling</a> is the process of responding to the occurrence of events – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing – during the execution of a program; often originating asynchronously from the external environment.

## Event driven programming

In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming" target="_blank">event-driven programming</a>, different parts of the program execute at different times based on user actions. These actions could occur at any time, such as the click of a button or the expiration of the timer. In conventional programming programs usually run beginning to end, but event-driven programming is persistent and reactionary.
