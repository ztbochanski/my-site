A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree" target="_blank">derivation</a> is a sequential application of production rules to generate a sentence in the language.

> It is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of a string according to some context-free grammar. The term parse tree itself is used primarily in computational linguistics; in theoretical syntax, the term syntax tree is more common.

```
String := Start Symbol
REPEAT
  Choose a nonterminal N in String
  Find a production rule with N on left-hand side
  Replace N with one of the right-hand options
UNTIL String contains only terminals
```

## Precedence and Associativity

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations" target="_blank">precedence</a> is the order in which operators are evaluated.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Associativity" target="_blank">Associativity</a> is the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated.

## Ambiguous Grammars

An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguous_grammar" target="_blank">ambiguous grammar</a> is a grammar for which there are multiple parse trees (leftmost derivation) for a given string.
