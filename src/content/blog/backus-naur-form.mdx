# Backus-Naur Form

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form" target="_blank">BNF</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntax" target="_blank">metasyntax</a> notation for describing the syntax of context-free languages. It is widely used in the design of programming languages and communication protocols.

## Overview

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)" target="_blank">sentence</a> is a string of characters over some alphabet. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language" target="_blank">language</a> is a set of sentences. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Lexeme" target="_blank">lexeme</a> is the lowest level syntactic unit of a language. These include numbers `5`, operators `\*`, keywords `while`, or special symbols `{ or )`.

A lexical token is a category of lexeme. It is a sequence of characters representing a symbol with a specific associated meaning. For example, an identifier is a token that can represent specific lexemes, such as x or count.

A metalanguage is a language used to define other languages. A formal grammar is a metalanguage used to define the syntax of a language.

## Terminals

A terminal is a lexeme that cannot be broken down into smaller lexemes. For example, the lexeme `while` is a terminal. The lexeme `while (x < 5)` is not a terminal because it can be broken down into smaller lexemes, such as `while`, `(`, `x`, `<`, `5`, and `)`.

## Non-terminals

A non-terminal is a lexeme that can be broken down into smaller lexemes. For example, the lexeme `while (x < 5)` is a non-terminal because it can be broken down into smaller lexemes, such as `while`, `(`, `x`, `<`, `5`, and `)`.

## Production Rules

A production rule is a rule that defines the syntax of a language. It is a set of production rules that define the syntax of a language. A production rule has the following form:

```bnf
<non-terminal> ::= <terminal> | <non-terminal> <terminal> | <non-terminal> <non-terminal>
