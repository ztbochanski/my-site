In imperative programming, a series of sequential changes to program state occurs. The [assignment](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)>)<Icon name="noto:link" class="inline" /> statement stands as the primary mechanism for altering variable values stored in memory.

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators include:

- `=` Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.

### More Assignment Operators<Icon name="noto:star-struck" class="inline ml-1 w-8 h-8" />

Additional assignment operators include

- `+=` Adds the right operand's value to the left operand.
- `-=` Subtracts the right operand's value from the left operand.
- `*=` Multiplies the left operand by the right operand.
- `/=` Divides the left operand by the right operand.
- `%=` Computes the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
- `<<=` Left-shifts the left operand by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
- `>>=` Right-shifts the left operand by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
- `&=` Performs a bitwise AND operation on the left and right operands.
- `^=` Performs a bitwise XOR operation on the left and right operands.
- `|=` Performs a bitwise OR operation on the left and right operands.

## Assignment Expressions <Icon name="noto:megaphone" class="inline ml-1 w-8 h-8" />

Assignment expressions involve assigning a value to a variable. The assigned value becomes the value of the expression.

Examples of assignment expressions:

- `a = b` Assigns the value of `b` to `a`.
- `a += b` Adds `b` to `a` and assigns the result to `a`.
- `a -= b` Subtracts `b` from `a` and assigns the result to `a`.

## Conditional Assignment <Icon name="noto:question-mark" class="inline ml-1 w-8 h-8" />

Conditional assignment executes only if a condition holds true.

Example:

- `a = b if c` Assigns `b` to `a` if `c` is true.

## Compound Assignment <Icon name="noto:hammer" class="inline ml-1 w-8 h-8" />

Compound assignment involves multi-step assignments.

Examples:

- `a = b + c` Assigns the sum of `b` and `c` to `a`.
- `a = b * c` Assigns the product of `b` and `c` to `a`.

## Chained Assignment <Icon name="noto:chains" class="inline ml-1 w-8 h-8" />

Chained assignment assigns a variable's value to another variable.

Example:

- `a = b = c` Assigns the value of `c` to `b` and `a`.

## Parallel Assignment <Icon name="noto:parachute" class="inline ml-1 w-8 h-8" />

Parallel assignment assigns multiple values to multiple variables simultaneously.

Example:

- `a, b = c, d` Assigns `c` to `a` and `d` to `b`.
