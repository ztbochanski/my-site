<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">Object oriented programming</a> is a programming paradigm that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)" target="_blank">objects</a> to model real world things that we want to represent inside of our programs, or provides a structured way to design programs.

Object-oriented programming centers around the instantiation of these class types, known as objects, and the interaction of objects with objects, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing" target="_blank">message-passing</a>.

Four main principles of object-oriented programming are:

- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)" target="_blank">Abstraction</a>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)" target="_blank">Inheritance</a>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)" target="_blank">Polymorphism</a>

## Classes

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" target="_blank">Classes</a> are `abstract data types` that provide a way to abstract `data` (fields) and `behavior` (methods).

## Objects

An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)" target="_blank">object</a> can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method. As regions of memory, they contain value and are referenced by identifiers.

In the object-oriented programming paradigm, object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures; in particular in class-based variations of the paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class.
